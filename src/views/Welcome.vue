                        I'm a full-stack web developer with a keen eye for design and a passion for developing
                        applications to solve real-world problems. In addition to more than two and a half years of experience
                        with programming on both the front and back ends, I possess more than seven years of 
                        professional experience with creative problem solving.

                        My higher education includes a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Business Management as well as a certification
                        in web development through the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. Technical skills include HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and database manipulation. Certified by the American Society of
                        Quality in process improvement, I am highly skilled with process flowcharting (an invaluable
                        tool in application development). In a collaborative environment, I enjoy teaching others and
                        sharing my knowledge for the benefit of the team.
